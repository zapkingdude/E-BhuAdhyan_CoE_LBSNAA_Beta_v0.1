1. Introduction of the
NAKSHA Programme:

All  India  Debt  and  Investment  Survey,  2019  (NSSO)  highlights  that  90%  of  assets  of
individuals in India are held as land and building. Various studies reveal that 2/3rd of
the private disputes in subordinate courts in India relate to land and building. Lack
of updated land records and maps are one of the main reasons for this. According
to  a  McKinsey  study  (2001),  land  market  distortions  cost  India  about  1.3%  in  GDP
growth.  Another  McKinsey  report  (2020),  highlights  that  informal  settlements  and
unregistered  land  could  be  formalized  by  speeding  up  the  digitization  of  land
records,  cadastral  maps,  and  surveys,  deploying  modern  technologies  including
Differential  Global  Positioning  System  (DGPS)  and  aerial  survey.  These  exercises
would also significantly ease the process of land acquisition in urban and peri urban
landscape.

The  reforms  in  urban  planning  capacity  in  India  report  of  2021  by  NITI  Aayog
has elaborated the need of spatial planning of urban areas. Further, cities play
a  decisive  role  in  achieving  India’s  commitments  to  global  agendas,  such  as
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030: UN-Habitat’s new
urban agenda; and the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework
Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC).  The  SDGs  specifically  Goal  11
(making  cities  inclusive,  safe,  resilient,  and  sustainable)  promote  urban
planning  as  one  of  the  recommended  methods  for  achieving  sustainable
development.  They  include  a  new  focus  on  participatory  and  integrated
planning for urban areas, peri-urban areas, and rural areas land resources.

One of the major components of urban planning are land records and property
management  which  requires  very  precise  survey,  resurvey  and  creation  &
updation of the land records. This includes setting up ground control network
and  the  process  of  cadastral  revenue  map  (if  any)  overlaid  on  very  high-
resolution  base  map  or  GIS  ready  topographical  layers  generated  using
property  tax  database,  layout  plans  etc.  Hybrid  method  involves  use  of
professional  survey  grade  Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicle  (UAV)/  Drone  for  large
scale mapping and precise field measurements by DGPS or Global Navigation
Satellite  System  (GNSS)  Receivers  (also  known  as  GNSS  Rovers).  Since  many
(ULBs)  have  multistorey  structures,  congested
Urban  Local  Bodies 
constructions  narrow roads and streets, this calls for mapping the ULBs in 3D
environment to accurately capture, visualize and interpret the ownership data
and other categorization of property in spatial domain. 
The  digitization  of  urban  land  records  is  an  essential  step  towards  achieving
transparency,  efficiency,  and  accountability  in  land  administration.  While  the
Government of India (GoI) has made significant progress in digitizing rural land
India  Land  Records
records  through 
Modernization Programme (DILRMP) of Department of Land Resources (DoLR)
and  the  Survey  of  Villages  Abadi  and  Mapping  with  Improvised  Technology  in
Village Areas (SVAMITVA) scheme of Ministry of Panchayat Raj (MoPR), but the
urban and peri urban areas are completely unaddressed. These areas often

initiatives  such  as  the  Digital 

Page: 03

lack  clear  update  and  accessible  land  records,  including  Record  of  Rights  (RoRs),
cadastral  maps  and  their  digital  linkages  which  leads  to  uncertainties,  prolonged
legal disputes and numerous grievances.

Strengthening  the  urban  and  peri-urban 
land  records  system  by  creating,
modernizing,  updating,  integrating  records  and  maps  is  the  need  of  the  hour.
Hon’ble Finance Minister of India in her July  2024-2025 Budget Speech emphasized
that

  “Land-related  reforms  by  state  governments  (para  98)  –  Land  related  reforms  and
actions, both in rural and urban areas, will cover (1) land administration, planning and
management,  and  (2)  urban  planning,  usage  and  building  bylaws.  These  will  be
incentivized  for  completion  within  the  next  3  years  through  appropriate  fiscal
support.

Rural  Land  related  actions  (para  99)  –  Rural  land  related  actions  will  include  (1)
assignment of Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) or Bhu-Aadhaar for
all  lands,  (2)  digitization  of  cadastral  maps,  (3)  survey  of  map  subdivisions  as  per
current ownership, (4) establishment of land registry, and (5) linking to the farmers
registry. These actions will also facilitate credit flow and other agricultural services. 
Urban Land related actions (para 100) – Land records in urban areas will be digitized
with GIS mapping. An IT based system for property record administration, updating,
and  tax  administration  will  be  established.  These  will  also  facilitate  improving  the
financial position of urban local bodies.” 

(Source:  www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/budget_speech.pdf  -  Government  of  India,
Budget 2024-2025, Speech of Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of Finance, July 23, 2024,
page no. 18, para 98, 99 and 100)

To  bridge  this  gap,  NAtional  geospatial  Knowledge-based  land  Survey  of  urban
HAbitations  (NAKSHA)  Programme  is  sanctioned  to  create  and  digitize  urban  and
peri-urban  land  records,  offering  an  integrated  solution  that  leverages  modern
surveying  and  mapping  technologies,  by  Department  of  Land  Resources,
Government of India since September 2024.

Under  this  proposed  pogramme  the  demarcation  of  government  land,  public  land,
various utilities like roads, railways, etc., inhabited land in urban and peri urban areas
would  be  done  using  aerial  surveying  technology  with  the  collaborative  efforts  of
the  Department  of  Land  Resources  (DoLR),  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  (MoRD),
Government of India; Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), Government of
India;  Survey  of  India  (SoI),  Dehradun;  State  Revenue  &  Urban  Development
Department/  Local  Self  Government,  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Electronics
Development  Corporation  (MPSEDC),  Bhopal,  National  Informatics  Centre  Services
IncOR (NICSI).

“The  NAKSHA  Pilot  Programme  has  been  initiated  by  the  Department  of  Land
Resources  in  152  ULBs/Local  Self-Government  across  the  country  with  Survey  of
India  as  Technical  Partner  which  would  cover  the  aerial  survey  and  feature
extraction part. The State/UT Governments would complete the field survey, ground
truthing  and  final  publication  of  urban  and  peri-urban  land  records.  As  of  now  29
States/UTs are participating in the Pilot Programme with a variable number of Urban
Local Bodies (ULBs) to a maximum of target per State/UT

2. Objectives of NAKSHA
Programme

The  NAKSHA  Programme  is  designed  to  support  urban,  peri-urban  and  regional
planning  by  generating  and  providing  high-quality,  geospatial  data  to  the
States/UTs. It is essential to prioritize the creation of land records in urban and peri-
urban  areas  to  enhance  the  ease  of  living  for  citizens,  streamline  the  urban  land
records  optimization  and  improve  overall  urban  development  outcomes,  including
better property tax collection, urban planning and redevelopment. It would also lead
to ease of business by way of easier access to credits, precise geospatial decisions,
and  ownership  clarity  etc.  A  key  step  in  this  direction  is  the  creation  of  the  urban
land  record  system  which  provides  comprehensive  and  reliable  information  for  all
urban land parcels within ULBs and peri-urban areas in an easily accessible format. 

Given the limitations of existing datasets, the most reliable approach to establishing
such  a  system  is  to  conduct  a  survey  and  create  a  database  using  the  latest
technology.  This  process  should  include  robust  safe  guards  by  cross-referencing
existing  data  bases  and  actively  involving  citizens  through  ground  truthing  and  a
transparent  process  for  addressing  objections.  This  approach  ensures  accuracy,
reliability and public trust in the new urban land record system. 

The primary objectives of the NAKSHA Programme are:

a)  Creation  of  urban  land  records:  To  create  spatial  data
enabled  urban  land  records  system  as  a  comprehensive,
digitized and accurate database in urban and peri-urban areas
latest  technologies  and  to  correlate  the  existing
using 
digitized town survey records wherever available

b)  Creation  of  Web  GIS  platform:  To  develop  a  user-friendly
end-to-end  Web  GIS  platform  that  allows  Government  and
citizens to access urban land records allowing interoperability
of data across sectors. 

c)  Empower  Urban  Citizens  and  improve  ease  of  living:
Creation  of  urban  land  records  resulting  in  reduction  of
disputes,  simplification  of  access  to  urban  utilities 
like
electricity, water, telephone, etc and credit facilities.

d)  Better  financial  health  of  urban  local  bodies:  Scientific
accurate  and  transparent  property  taxation  regime  would
improve financial health of ULBs.
Better  Urban  Planning:  Provide  geospatially  accurate  data  to
support scientific urban planning and disaster resilience. 

e)  Better  Urban  Planning:  Provide  geospatially  accurate  data
to  support  scientific  urban  planning,  redevelopment  and
disaster resilience & management.

The  one-year  Pilot  Programme  NAKSHA  would  be  implemented  in  152  cities  across  the
country  with  Survey  of  India  (SoI)  as  a  Technical  Partner  under  Digital  India  Land  Records
Modernization  Programme  (DILRMP).  It  is  also  propossed  that  based  on  the  learnings  and
outcomes  of  the  pilot,  a  larger  Programme  covering  all  the  cities  and  towns  would  be
implemented across the country in a phase wise manner. 

The cities where the pilot Programme NAKSHA would be carried out have been selected by
the  DoLR  based  on  the  proposals  submitted  by  the  States  and  UTs.  From  26  States  and  3
UTs  for  more  than  220  ULBs  were  proposed  for  the  pilot.  After  detailed  consultation  with
concerned  States/UTs, the DoLR shortlisted 152 ULBs for the pilot phase. Out of 152 ULBs,
128 ULBs have been sanctioned for Aerial Survey under NAKSHA Project and for others the
ORIs are available with the State/UTs. The ULBs received from the States/UTs are based on
the categories (a) A typical old city expanding horizontally, (b) A newly developed planned
city with Peri-Urban areas, and (c) A city growing vertically at a rapid pace. Then selected
ULBs details are shared to SoI.

5.4 Methodologies adopted for Aerial
Data Acquisition

5.4.1 Nadir (Vertically Oriented) Imaging:

Nadir imaging refers to capturing images directly downward sensors, perpendicular to the
ground. The camera's optical axis is aligned vertically with respect to the earth's surface.

Characteristics:

Provides a "top-down" view of
the ground.
Ensures minimal perspective
distortion, making it ideal for
orthoimage generation.
Best suited for mapping flat
terrain and capturing large
areas efficiently.

Applications:

Orthoimage generation for
accurate mapping.
Urban planning and cadastral
surveys.
Land use classification and land
use change monitoring.

Figure 5.2: Nadir Camera
(Source: www.phaseone.com) 

5.4.2 Oblique (Angled) Imaging:

Oblique  imaging  involves  capturing  images  at  an  angle  (typically  between  30°  to  60°  from
vertical)  rather  than  straight  down.  These  images  provide  a  perspective  view  of  features,
including the sides of buildings and other vertical structures.

Characteristics:

Provides a "top-down" view of
the ground.
Ensures minimal perspective
distortion, making it ideal for
orthoimage generation.
Best suited for mapping flat
terrain and capturing large
areas efficiently.

Applications:

Orthoimage generation for
accurate mapping.
Urban planning and cadastral
surveys.
Land use classification and land
use change monitoring.

Figure 5.3: oblique-camera

(Source: www.mavdrones.com)          

Page: 17

5.4.3 Combined Oblique + LiDAR Systems:

This  system  integrates  oblique  cameras  with  LiDAR  (Light  Detection  and  Ranging)  sensors
to  capture  both  visual  imagery  and  precise  elevation  data.  LiDAR  uses  laser  pulses  to
measure distances and generate high-resolution 3D point clouds.

Characteristics:

Provides both textural detail (from
oblique imagery) and accurate
elevation data (from LiDAR). 
Highly effective for mapping
dense vegetation or rugged
terrains where photographic
imagery alone may not be
sufficient.
Enables the generation of Digital
Surface Models (DSMs) and 3D
models with enhanced accuracy.

Applications:

Detailed 3D city modelling and
infrastructure planning.
Disaster management,
including landslide risk
assessment and flood
modelling.

Figure-5.13: Sample flight plan to understand side & front overlap to get Nadir images 
(Source: www.jouav.com) 

5.6.1 Rationale in flight plan:

a. High overlap ensures the generation of distortion-free ortho-rectified imagery.

b. Balance altitude based on GSD requirements (e.g., 5cm GSD).

c.  However,  based  on  terrain  condition,  tall  building,  trees,  power  lines  or  windmills,  the

above    conditions of overlaps, flights patterns may change

Page: 22

5.7 Ortho Rectified Imagery (ORI)

a.  Ortho Rectified Imagery is a geo-referenced image of the Earth’s surface from top view.

b.  Raw aerial imagery cannot be used in GIS until processed by Photogrammetry technique to

generate accurate georeferenced images, referred to as orthorectified images or orthoimages.

c.  Raw photos are from an inclined angle. ORIs are generated from Raw photos to build Images

from the Top View.

d.   Any object's true shape and location can only be determined from ORI.

Figure 5.14: Difference between raw image and orthorectified image (ORI)

e.  ORI creation involves transforming raw aerial imagery into a geometrically corrected format

that accurately represents the Earth's surface. This process removes distortions caused by

camera tilt, terrain elevation, and sensor irregularities.

f.  ORI enables to have details of shadow area and corrects the distortion for correction of geo-

location and measurements as in the raw images.

g.  Georeferencing: Involves Aligning imageries with geographic coordinates using GPS and

Ground Control Points (GCPs).

h.  Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Integration: To adjust for terrain-induced distortions.

i.  Orthorectification Process involves application of mathematical models to correct image

distortions by using specialized software like ERDAS IMAGINE, ArcGIS, or QGIS or any other

required software.

j.  Quality Assurance: Validate the output against reference datasets for accuracy (e.g., RMSE

checks)

Page: 23

5.8 Quality Check

Survey of India (SoI) to do quality check to ensure that their empaneled agency provide the

ORIs/DEMs/3D Models as per the standards mentioned in the Request For Proposal.

5.8.1 Checking Quality of ORI
a.  Checking the quality of orthorectified imagery is crucial to ensure its accuracy and

usability for mapping, analysis, and other geospatial applications. Steps to evaluate the

quality systematically:

b.  Verify that the features (e.g., roads, buildings, rivers) align correctly with a trusted

reference map or other high-accuracy datasets.

c.  Look for visible seam lines, distortions, or artifacts that may indicate poor stitching or

processing of ORI.

d.  Check for uniformity in image brightness, contrast, and color balance across the entire

dataset.

e.  Compare control points from the imagery with ground control points (GCPs) from a

reliable source, such as survey data or GPS measurements.

f.  Measure the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to quantify positional accuracy. Ideally, the

RMSE should be within the acceptable tolerance i.e. 2 cm (as per RFP)

g.  Overlay the imagery on a known base layer (e.g., cadastral maps, GIS layers) and validate

the alignment of features (buildings, roads) with the base layer.

h.  Check if the Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) matches the project requirements i.e. 5

cm.

i.  Verify details about the satellite or sensor that captured the imagery.

j.  Evaluate the clarity of edges and features (e.g., roads, buildings) using zoomed-in views.

k.  Test the imagery against scale-specific benchmarks to ensure the imagery meets

required map scales for its intended use.

l.  For tiled imagery, ensure seamless integration without misalignment or mismatched

features at tile boundaries

m.  Cross-check features on the imagery against field observations using check points

(preferably pre-pointed) given by using SoI’s CORS in Network Real Time Kinematic (NRTK)

positioning mode for drone data validation.

5.8.2 Checking Quality of extracted features

Compare the spatial location of extracted features i.e. Road, Building, Land parcel, 3D files

with high-accuracy reference dataset.

a.   Ensure extracted features align with ORI

b. Verify that attribute data (e.g., name, type, classification) matches the real-world

characteristics of the feature.

c.  Ensure no missing or incorrect attribute values and validate attributes against

predefined standards or schemas.

Page: 24

d.  Ensure that all the visible features like land parcels, building footprints, roads, water

bodies etc. within the area of interest are extracted.

e.  Use overlays to identify missing features when compared to reference datasets

f.  Confirm all mandatory attributes are populated for each feature.

g. Check for overlapping polygons, duplicate features, or gaps between polygons.

h.  Validate connectivity for line features (e.g., road or river networks).

i.  Ensure polygons are closed, lines are not self-intersecting, and points are not duplicated.

j. Compare 3D points (X, Y, Z coordinates) with ground control points (GCPs) or a trusted

reference dataset.

k. Validate the relative height of features (e.g., buildings on terrain) against a Digital

Elevation Model (DEM).

l. Test the file in the intended software environment (e.g., QGIS, Blender, AutoCAD) to

confirm usability.

m. Render the vector file in 3D visualization software to identify anomalies like misplaced

features, distorted geometries, or gaps.

n.  Verify that the point density (e.g., points per square meter) meets project specifications.

o.  Ensure uniform distribution of points across the area of interest; detect gaps or

clustering.

p.  Ensure all areas of the target region are covered without omissions.

q.  Assess the accuracy of classified points (e.g., ground, vegetation, buildings, water,

noise).

r.  Compare classified layers against reference datasets or manually inspect sections of the

point cloud

s. Ensure features are consistently classified across the dataset, with no misclassification

(e.g., buildings classified as vegetation).

t. Verify flight parameters such as altitude, speed, scan angle, and overlap meet

specifications

u. Confirm that metadata includes processing details (e.g., filtering methods, classification

algorithms).

6. MAP-2:Field Survey
and Ground Truthing
6.1 Field Survey of Land Parcel

The field survey of land parcels/property boundary and cadastral information in urban and

peri-urban  areas  is  crucial  for  ensuring  legal  clarity,  effective  governance  and  sustainable

development. It plays a key role in resolving ownership disputes and updating land records.

In  a  country  with  outdated  records,  fragmented  landholding  and  complex  inheritance

systems, field surveys provide the foundation for digital transformation, sustainable growth

and efficient land use. Conducting a field survey of a land parcel involves systematic steps

to gather accurate data about the land's location, size, shape, boundaries and features.The

input  for  Map  2  i.e.  Field  Survey  and  Ground  Truthing  is  an  output  of  Map-1.  In  Map-1,

Boundary  layers  are  to  be  extracted  based  on  topographical  markers.  Where  aerial  data

acquisition is not being done under NAKSHA project, the already available data (ORIs) with

respective states will act as input for Map -2. In Map -2, these layers will be ground validated

and  field  survey  will  be  conducted  for  ascertaining  land  parcel/property  boundaries  along

with attribute data collection related to Cadastral information.

a.    In  most  cases  the  property  parcel/boundary  will  follow  a  topographical  feature  like

boundary  wall,  fences,  common  junctions  of  adjacent  buildings,  hedges,  bunds,  etc.  Such

features will be visible in the hard/ soft copy of Map/ORI generated as the output of MAP-1.

The same can be confirmed on the ground by field survey team and traced as part of land

parcel/property boundary layer.

b.    Some  portion  of  the  land-parcel/  property  boundary  will  not  be  visible  in  the  Map/ORI

taken as input for Field Survey i.e. Map-2. These missing boundary vertices/portions will be

surveyed on the ground using precise instruments like GNSS Receivers (also known as GNSS

Rovers), Electronic Total Station integrated with GNSS, Laser Range Finder, etc. depending

on the site conditions and availability of the instruments with States/UTs.

c.    All  field  survey  activities  can  be  carried  out  by  using  field  devices  like  survey  grade  (i)

GNSS Receivers (also known as GNSS Rovers) in NRTK/Static Mode integrated with/without

field  data  collector  connected  to  Central  Database  through  an  enterprise  GIS  Server  in

online/offline mode, (ii) ETS GNSS etc. depending on the terrain conditions and availability

of the instruments with States/UTs.

d.  All field survey activities can be carried out by using GNSS Rovers, Real-Time Kinematic

(RTK)  positioning  GPS,  Electronic  Total  Station  (ETS)  etc.  depending  on  the  terrain

conditions and availability of the instruments with States/UTs.

6.2 Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) Rovers
a.  GNSS Receivers (also known as GNSS Rovers) are devices that use the Global Navigation

Satellite  System  (GNSS)  to  determine  precise  geographic  locations  on  Earth.  These  are

widely  used  in  surveying  &  mapping,  agriculture,  construction,  and  other  applications

requiring high-accuracy positioning. GNSS rovers receive signals from multiple satellites in

constellations  like  GPS  (USA),  GLONASS  (Russia),  Galileo  (Europe),  and  BeiDou  (China).

These  satellites  transmit  signals  with  information  about  their  location  and  the  time  the

signal  was  sent.  By  receiving  signals  from  at  least  four  satellites,  the  rover  calculates  its

position  using  a  process  called  triangulation.  The  distance  to  each  satellite  is  measured

based on the time it takes for receiving the signal to the rover. 

b.    In  standalone  mode,  the  coordinates  obtained  from  GNSS  observations  are  burdened

with  many  errors  like  Satellite  Clock  and  orbit  error,  Ionospheric  delay  and  Tropospheric

delay,  Receiver  Noise,  Multipath  and  Receiver  Clock  error.  Due  to  the  above  errors  the

coordinates obtained are inaccurate and need to be corrected before use. To minimize the

effect  of  these  errors,  the  GNSS  data  of  observation  points  needs  to  be  processed  with

reference to some known reference stations whose coordinates are accurately known to us.

The  reference  stations  are  of  two  types  which  includes  CORS  Network  established  by  SOI

(Active  Network  of  Reference  Stations)  and  SOI’s  GCPs  (Passive  Network  of  Reference

Stations)

c.    The  positioning  obtained  from  the  GNSS  receiver  collects  satellite  signals  and  receives

the  correction  data  from  the  reference  station  in  real-time  through  a  communication  link.

By  applying  these  corrections  to 

its  raw  GNSS  measurements,  the  rover  achieves

centimeter-level positional accuracy.

6.2.1 Key Component of GNSS Rovers

At 

its  core 

is  the  GNSS  Receiver,  which  processes  signals  from  multiple  satellite

constellations (e.g., GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) to determine theReceivers (also known

as  GNSS  Rovers)’s  location.  This  is  paired  with  a  high-performance  antenna  that  ensures

clear  and  reliable  signal  reception,  even  in  challenging  environments  like  urban  areas  or

dense  forests.  A  data  collector  acts  as  the  interface,  storing  and  processing  positional

information and often running software for real-time mapping and analysis. To achieve high

accuracy,  GNSS  Receivers  (also  known  as  GNSS  Rovers)  also  feature  a  communication

module, which connects to CORS correction services via radio or cellular networks, enabling

techniques 

like  Network  Real-Time  Kinematic  (NRTK)  for  centimeter-level  precision.

Additionally,  these  systems  are  ruggedized  for  durability,  with  weather-resistant  casings

and ergonomic designs for fieldwork. Together, these components enable GNSS Receivers

(also  known  as  GNSS  Rovers)  to  deliver  reliable,  precise,  and  efficient  solutions  for  a  wide

range of applications

Page: 30

Figure 6.1: GNSS Rover and its components

6.3 Real-Time Kinematic (RTK)
positioning GPS

Real-Time  Kinematic  (RTK)  GPS  is  a  high-precision  positioning  system  that  enhances  the

accuracy  of  standard  GPS  signals  by  using  carrier-phase  measurements  and  corrections

from  a  reference  station.  It  consists  of  a  reference  station  and  a  rover  unit.  In  reference

station,  a  stationary  GPS  receiver  at  a  known  location,  continuously  monitors  satellite

signals  and  calculates  correction  data  by  comparing  its  actual  position  to  the  satellite-

provided  position.  The  rover  unit,  which  is  a  mobile  GPS  receiver,  collects  satellite  signals

and  receives  the  correction  data  from  the  reference  station  in  real-time  through  a

communication link. By applying these corrections to its raw GPS measurements, the rover

achieves centimeter-level positional accuracy.

6.4 Electronic Total Station (ETS) GNSS

Electronic  Total  Station  (ETS)  GNSS  combines  the  functionalities  of  a  traditional  Electronic

Total  Station  (ETS)  and  Global  Navigation  Satellite  System  (GNSS)  to  deliver  enhanced

precision  and  versatility  in  surveying  and  geospatial  applications.  An  ETS  measures  angles

(both horizontal and vertical) and distances using laser or infrared technology, while GNSS

provides  accurate  positional  data  by  receiving  signals  from  satellites.  Integrating  these

systems enables surveyors to conduct precise measurements over long distances, even in

challenging terrains where one system alone might be insufficient.

Page: 31

6.5 Field Data Collector (FDC) with a Web
GIS software for Field Survey

A  Field  Data  Collector  refers  to  a  device  or  system  optimized  for  collecting  and  recording

GIS  data  in  the  field,  meaning  outside  of  a  laboratory  or  office  setting.  Typically,  FDC  is  a

rugged tablet that works with GNSS Receivers (also known as GNSS Rovers) / ETS, allowing

surveyors  to  view  and  visualize  ORIs  and  collect/extract  features  (including  boundary

points) in the field. Also, it can be linked with GNSS Receivers (also known as GNSS Rovers)

for feature extraction and updation of land parcels. It also enables collection and linking of

attribute  data  in  the  field.  For  end-to-end  digital  work  flow,  these  field  devices  are

connected to a central database through an enterprise GIS Server to enable transmission of

field  data  to  the  central  database  server.  In  order  to  achieve  field  survey  accuracies

required  for  the  NAKSHA  Project  through  measurements,  the  FDCs  should  be  integrated

with CORS Network through a survey grade GNSS Receiver.

6.6 Distance-Distance measurement
Laser Range Finder

A Distance-Distance Measurement Laser Range Finder is a specialized tool used to measure

the distance between two points using laser technology. In Land Surveys, it can be used to

measure  distances  between  various  points,  such  as  corners  of  a  property,  slopes,  and

terrain  features.  The  measurement  of  a  point  which  is  not  visible  on  ORI  by  occupying  at

least  two  well  identifiable  points  that  can  been  related  between  ORI  and  Ground  and

measuring the distance from these points to the missing vertex on the property boundary.

The  exact  position  of  the  above-mentioned  vertex  can  be  marked  in  the  GIS  environment

using tools for distance-distance arc intersection.

6.7 Reference Stations

The coordinates obtained from GPS/GNSS observations are burdened with many errors like

Satellite  Clock  and  orbit  error,  Ionospheric  delay  and  Tropospheric  delay,  Receiver  Noise,

Multipath  and  Receiver  Clock  error.  Due  to  the  above  errors  the  coordinates  obtained  are

inaccurate and need to be corrected before use. To minimize the effect of these errors the

GPS/GNSS data of observation points needs to be processed with reference to some known

reference  stations  whose  coordinates  are  accurately  known  to  us.  The  reference  stations

are  of  two  types  which  includes  CORS  Network  established  by  SOI  (Figure  6.1.2)  GCPs

(Passive Network of Reference Stations).

Page: 32

6.8 Continuously Operating Reference
Stations (CORS)

Survey of India has established Continuously Operating Reference System across India as a

part  of  India’s  National  Geodetic  Reference  Frame.  In  total,  SOI  has  established  1047

permanent  CORS  reference  stations  and  is  under  active  consideration  of  densifying  the

same.  Also,  as  per  the  requirement  of  CORS  densification  under  NAKSHA,  SOI  is  actively

engaged  with  DoLR,  GoI  for  densification  of  CORS  network  in  (Temporary  and  Permanent

stations)  Towns/ULBs.  CORS 

is  a  real  time  positioning  service  for  accurate  GNSS

observations by general public. CORS services enables user to get the position data with 3-5

mins of observation with an accuracy of 2-3 cm. Earlier, to get a accurate position of a point,

SOI’s  Ground  control  points  were  used  and  it  took  almost  2-3  days  to  get  the  precise

location  of  a  point.  CORS  is  a  system  of  interconnected,  permanent  GNSS  (Global

Navigation Satellite System) base stations that provide high-

precision  positioning  data  to

users 

in 

real-time  or  post-

processed 

modes. 

Each

reference  station  in  the  network

is equipped with a high-precision

GNSS 

receiver  and  antenna,

continuously  collecting  satellite

signals  from  constellations  such

as  GPS,  GLONASS,  Galileo,  or  Bei

Dou.  The  data  is  processed  to

generate 

corrections 

that

compensate for errors caused by

atmospheric 

interference,

satellite  orbit  inaccuracies,  and

clock  deviations.  The  network

computers 

and 

distributes

correction  data  to  rover  units

(GNSS  Rovers)  via  the  internet,

radio,  or  cellular  networks.  Users

connect  to  the  network  through

specialized software or hardware

and  receive  these  corrections  to

enhance 

their 

positional

accuracy.

6.9 Survey of India Ground Control Points

SOI  GCPs  also  known  as  Passive  Network  of  Reference  Stations,  are  a  network  of

established  geodetic  reference  points  used  in  India  for  high-precision  surveys,  mapping,

and  geospatial  applications.  These  Ground  Control  Points  (GCPs)  are  fixed  physical

locations  with  accurately  determined  coordinates  (latitude,  longitude,  and  elevation),

typically  obtained  through  precise  geodetic  measurements.  These  GCPs  has  cement

concrete structure/Monumentation and can be located on the ground by their description

which is available with SOI. The SOI has established a Ground Control Point (GCP) Library of

about  2500  Ground  Control  Points  in  the  entire  country.  These  GCPs  define  the  Horizontal

datum  of  the  country  and  can  be  used  for  various  surveying,  mapping  and  developmental

activities.

6.10 Team constitution

The  team  constitution  for  a  land  parcel  survey  typically  involves  a  combination  of  skilled

professionals who work together to ensure accurate data collection, analysis, and reporting.

The state can choose any number of team within the budget allocation for each ULB, but the

core team members generally include the following:

1.

 One Permanent staff (equivalent to Patwari/Talati) from the State Revenue Department.

        2.  One  Permanent  staff  (equivalent  to  Patwari/Talati/Inspector)  from  the  State  Urban

Department.

Page: 34

3.  One Department surveyor/hired surveyor for doing ETS survey

4.  One helper to assist the surveyor

5.  One vehicle with driver

6.11 Public meeting

1.

 Public awareness during field survey is an essential step in the land surveying process,

especially when the land parcel has implications for public interest, urban development,

infrastructure, or land rights. Public meetings serve as a platform for stakeholders—such

as landowners, government representatives, urban planners, and the general public—to

discuss and review the proposed survey, boundaries, and any issues related to land use

or ownership. The goal of a public meeting is to ensure transparency, gather feedback,

address concerns, and align the survey process with legal and community requirements.

2.

Public  meetings  should  be  advertised  in  advance  through  newspapers,  community

bulletins, official government websites, and direct communication with affected parties.

3.

 Notifications should include details such as the time, location, purpose, and agenda of

the meeting.

4.

  During  public  meetings  state  level  officer  (s)  must  present  an  overview  of  the  land

survey project and its importance and survey methods.

5.

  Land  holders  should  be  requested  at  the  meeting  to  clear  the  boundaries  of  their

properties  and  place  survey  marks  before  reaching  the  surveyor  for  field  demarcation

work.

6.

  State  level  officer(s)  must  address  any  concerns  raised  by  the  attendees,  offering

clarifications or explanations about the survey and its impact.

7.

  Officer(s)  must  maintain  official  records  of  the  meeting,  including  minutes,  questions

raised, and responses provided and notes any issues, suggestions, or concerns raised by

the public for further consideration.

8.

 Ensure that the survey complies with local government policies and that all stakeholders

are informed of the legal implications.

6.12 Field survey

Before starting the field survey, the field survey team must collect the legal documents,

existing  maps,  cadastral  records,  property  tax  details  from  the  revenue/urban

department of concerned ULBs. If state has online system (Web-GIS) for city survey, the

API  may  be  shared  with  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Electronics  Development  Corporation

(MPSEDC) GIS Platform a.for its seamless integration.

Wherever  available,  the  cadastral  plots,  layout  plans,  etc.,  should  be  georeferenced  for

extraction of legacy attribute data.

Page: 35

The team must carry the ORIs and extracted features received from SOI both in hard and

soft copy, preferably in FDC with Web GIS Field Software enabled with NRTK receiver. In

case  it  is  not  available,  survey  grade  NRTK  enabled  GNSS  Rovers  along  with  rugged

laptops  with  GIS  software  and  internet  connectivity  may  be  used  for  plotting  the

position of surveyed boundary points and digitizing the property boundary in the field

The survey team should use the Web GIS application of MPSEDC for field survey work.

The  Web  GIS  platform  enables  surveyors  to  view  the  a.ORIs  and  extracted  features.  It

can also be linked with GNSS rovers for feature extraction and updation of land parcels.

Survey  team  goes  to  the  field  with  the  sketch  and  marks  the  boundaries  of  existing

holdings.

Identify and document boundary markers or any physical landmarks on the ground.

If  the  boundaries  of  any  of  the  fields  were  not  demarcated  by  the  land  holders,  the

boundaries  of  those  fields  must  be  demarcated  by  the  surveyor  and  helper  in  the

presence of the land owners.

During  demarcation  of  each  holding,  the  surveyor  will  gather  the  name  of  registered

holders  of  the  plot,  its  classification,  revenue  number,  etc.  as  per  the  latest  revenue

records and as per the present enjoyment, for writing up the land register and online.

For  each  land  parcel  survey  team  needs  to  collect  information  mentioned  in  the  Urban

Property Card format given in para 7.5

When there are bunds or hedges between holdings, the center of these will as a rule, be

considered to be the true boundary, unless there is evidence to the contrary.

Survey team need to take the front view photographs of the building/parcel using a fairly  

high-resolution camera and ensure that it is geotagged.

Once  all  the  boundaries  of  the  land  parcel  are  identified  and  confirmed  by  the  land

owner, the team can proceed for the GNSS Rover survey, as required. 

Wherever  distinguishing  features  of  a  property/land  parcel  appears  on  ORI,  shall  be

vectorized with reference to such features. 

Wherever  property/land  parcel  boundaries  are  unable  to  be  demarcated  on  the  ORI,

those shall be measured on ground with DGPS/CORS rovers. 

Wherever  the  satellite  signal  is  poor  and  its  not  possible  to  collect  the  data  with  rover

due  to  the  dense  structures,  narrow  roads,  canopy  areas,  HT  lines  etc.,  the  coordinate

data  shall  be  collected  through  ETS  or  measurements  shall  be  taken  up  by  tape  and

converted into coordinate data.

The vectorization of land/property parcel boundaries shall be drawn with a combination

of above said data in GIS software.

During  the  Ground  Truthing  all 

land  parcels 

including  those  belonging  to  the  

government shall be denoted with a temporary number. Property ID/City survey number

shall  be  allotted  after  completion  of  survey  and  vectorization  of  all  land  parcels  and  its

approval by revenue/urban development officer of the ULB level team. 

Page: 36

6.13 Field Survey: Salient Instructions

1.

  Survey team goes to the field with the ORI map and identifies as well as documents

boundary markers or any physical landmarks on the ground and same should be

correlated with ORI map.

2.

6.14 Field Survey Methodologies

Following  are  the  Methodologies  for  Property  Boundary/Land  Parcel  Survey  by  State
Authorities:

6.14.1 FDC integrated with CORS network
through NRTK receiver:

The property parcel boundaries can be demarcated on ground using a Network RTK (NRTK)
enabled Rovers and Controller/Mobile application using the CORS network in the states
where the CORS network is functional. The desired positional accuracy could be achieved
using the CORS network in the states where the CORS network is functional. The desired
positional accuracy could be achieved using the CORS correction streams. Further,
extraction of property parcel boundary can be done simultaneously on the ground since the
ORI/ Map 1 can be visualized in the FDC and shape file of property boundary can be created.

Resources required:

    i. CORS network
    ii. NRTK enabled GNSS Receivers (also known as GNSS Rovers) having tilt sensors
    iii. FDC integrated with CORS network NRTK rover.
    iv. Laser Range Finder
    v. Hardcopy of ORI with digitized features
    vi. Trained manpower

Page: 37

 
6.14.2 GNSS Receiver integrated with CORS
Network

The property parcel boundaries can be demarcated on ground using a Network RTK (NRTK)

enabled  Receivers  (also  known  as  GNSS  Rovers)  using  the  CORS  network  by  taking

observation  of  demarcated  points  (especially  for  missing  vertices  in  ORI).  The  coordinates

thus  recorded  in  field  can  be  parallelly  plotted  using  rugged  laptop  with  GIS  Software  to

create  the  property  boundary  layer.  This  can  be  the  alternate  method  of  property

demarcation in the States were the CORS network is functional. 

Resources required:

    i.   CORS network

    ii.  NRTK enable GNSS Receivers (also known as GNSS Rovers) having tilt sensors

    iii. Laser Range Finder

    iv. Rugged Laptop with GIS Software

    v.  Hardcopy of Ortho plot

    vi. Trained manpower

6.14.3 Electronic Total Stations in combination
with GNSS:

The demarcation of property parcel boundaries on ground can be done using 3. Electronic

Total  Stations  in  combination  with  GNSS.  In  order  to  demarcate  the  property  parcel

boundaries,  Control  Points  (at  least  2  no.  GCPs)  are  to  be  established  in  field  survey  area

using GNSS Receivers (also known as GNSS Rovers). Using these two GCPs, total station can

be aligned and further the coordinates of the vertices of property parcels can be picked up.

The coordinates thus recorded in field can be parallelly plotted using rugged laptop with GIS

Software to create the property boundary layer. 

Resources required:

    i. GNSS instrument / CORS

    ii. Total Station

    iii. Rugged Laptop with GIS Software

    iv. Laser Range Finder

    v. Hardcopy of ORI with digitized features

    vi. Trained manpower

Page: 38

6.15 GNSS Rover Survey

The  Observation  of  land  parcels  should  be  done  using  the  GNSS  Receiver/Robotic  Total

Station, based on the GNSS network. In the case of RTS surveys each day, surveys should be

started  and  ended  at  known  value  stations.  When  selecting  a  GNSS  receiver  it  should  be

ensured  that  it  supports  CORS  (Continuously  Operating  Reference  Station)  networks  and

must have a tilt sensor.

6.16 Equipment Preparation

1.

  GNSS  Rover  Setup:  Ensure  the  GNSS  receiver  is  functional,  charged,  and  updated  with

the  latest firmware.

6.18 Survey Setup

1.

 Mount the GNSS receiver on a tripod or pole and position it vertically using the bubble

level.

2.

 Power on the receiver and check for satellite lock (at least 5 satellites for a 3D fix).

6.19 Establish Connection to CORS

1.

Primary  ways  to  establish  communication  between  the  rover  and  CORS  networks  via

internet Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol (NTRIP). This method allows

the rover to connect to the CORS network through the internet.

2.

Obtain  NTRIP  Access  Information:  Contact  the  CORS  provider  or  use  a  public  NTRIP

service. You will need an NTRIP caster URL, a username, and password (if required), and

the specific mount point of the CORS station.

3.

Configure  the  Rover:  In  the  rover’s  software  or  receiver  settings,  configure  the  NTRIP

client by entering the caster URL, mountpoint, and login credentials.

Page: 39

4.  Establish Connection: The rover will connect to the CORS network via the internet,

receive RTK corrections, and apply them in real-time for improved accuracy.

5.  Monitor the Connection: Ensure that the rover has an active connection to the CORS

network and that it is receiving correction data

6.20 Pair the GNSS receiver with the Field
Data Collector via Bluetooth

Open Bluetooth settings and pair with the GNSS receiver (default PIN: 0000). Connect to the

CORS network:

    i.   Enter the IP address and port of the CORS server.

    ii.  Input NTRIP credentials (username and password)

    iii. Verify real-time corrections are active.

6.21 Establish Base Point (if required)

 Start measurement and wait for the solution to show the value.

9.

 Person holding a rover must go to each corner of the land parcel according to the shape

and  record  the  point  coordinates  (latitude,  longitude,  elevation).  The  surveyor  should

carefully survey to see that the common points or boundary between two land parcels is

measured but once only so that there may be no difference between the measurements

recorded for such common points or boundaries.

10.

Special  considerations  need  to  be  given  for  corner  properties  which  are  located  at  the

intersection  of  two  roads,  having  at  least  one  vertex  (or  more)  common  with  the  road

boundary.  These  properties  are  critical  due  to  their  visibility  and  potential  for  disputes;

hence, they are always surveyed with special attention.

Page: 40

11.  All road-facing sides of corner properties must be measured during the survey.

12.  If property boundaries overlap with building structures (as seen in ORI), the case must

be reviewed, and corrections certified by the survey supervisor.

13.  Locate the corner vertices where property boundaries intersect with roads and use the

rover to precisely record these vertices with centimeter-level accuracy.

14.  Measure boundaries shared with neighboring properties, ensuring no overlap.

Figure-6.4: Illustration for land parcel survey

15.  Compare GNSS measurements with existing maps or property sketches and if variations

exceed 5 cm adjust the boundary polygon of existing maps or property sketches.

16.  Any variation of length between the lengths measured on the ground and as written in

the sketch which is less than 10 cm, need not be incorporated. For example if length in

digital sketch is 9.1 m and on the ground it is measured to be 9.17 m then the said 7 cm

variation need not be incorporated and 9.1 m shall remain unchanged. The variation in

excess of 10 cm shall be duly incorporated by rounding off to a single decimal place of

meters.

17.  Extreme variation in length which is more than 50 cm as compared to ORI determined

length should be re-measured by Survey Supervisor. Similarly, any change in lengths of the

side or otherwise which leads to drawing of the property boundary line over the building in

the ORI image, should be re-checked by Survey Supervisor and correction certified with

time stamp.

18.  Use offset measurement techniques for inaccessible points (e.g., behind obstructions).

19.  Re-measure points if positional accuracy exceeds project thresholds.

20.  The area of each land parcel should be computed by the Surveyor in the prescribed

Software.

21.  Add attribute information of each parcel (Survey No., Owner Name, Property tax details

etc.).

22.  Take the front view photograph of the land parcel/building

23.  Move to the next boundary point and repeat the measurement process.

Title confirmation guidelines and area mismatch guidelines for disposal of claims and

objections:

State Government shall define title enquiry and area mismatch reconciliation guidelines, in

respect of the procedure and the documents to be relied upon for determination of

ownership and disposal of claims and objections on the field.

Page: 43

Guidelines formulated by some states which have already undertaken the urban 

surveys, have been provided at Annexure-2. States can adopt these guidelines with

appropriate modifications or create their own Guidelines as required. Adherence to the

applicable provisions under the relevant Revenue Acts /Municipal Acts shall have to be

ensured when defining the Guidelines.

The documents to be relied upon for determination of ownership could be Record of Right,

Sale Deed, Lease Deed, Gift Deed, Relinquishment Deed, Settlement Deed, Occupancy

Certificate, Deed of Partition, lay out Plan, Property Tax Receipt, Building Sanction Plan, Will,

General Power of Attorney (GPA), Agreement to Sell (ATS), Utility Bills, Mutation Certificate

etc., or any other document as the state may decide, which shall be decided a case to case

basis.

of claims and objections

a.  In case of variations in the details in the two sets of the record (one available with the

survey team and the other presented by the land holder in possession at the site), due to

transfer of the land parcel/plot/property, by way of succession, sale, gift, relinquishment,

mortgage, partition and subdivision etc, not followed by updation, the land holder shall be

advised to submit an online application for updation of the ownership details. In case of

disputes over the ownership/boundaries being raised before the survey team, also the

parties shall be advised to submit online applications in support of their respective claims.

b.  Special efforts shall be made by the Revenue/Settlement/Municipal Authority concerned

accordance with the provisions of the applicable law, so as to limit the claims and

objections at the later stage after publication of MAP-2.

c)  Recording of commonly held land in housing societies 

Nodal  departments  of  state/UTs  would    notify  detailed    Guidelines  on  how  to  record

commonly held land in apartments complexes or colony/society land. If the state already

has such Guidelines, the same may be used.

If applicable, the nodal department also prescribes Guidelines on how to note individual

ownership  in  different  types  of  housing  societies,  including  leasehold  allotment,  group

housing societies, cooperative societies, apartment owners’ association, and others.

These should be in consultation with the Revenue and Urban development dept., and in

conjunction  with  the  new  Urban  Property  Card  format,  prescribed  in  this  SoP,  to  the

extent possible.

and objections and map
finalization

a) Documents for Determination of Land
Ownership in India
In  India,  land  ownership  is  determined  through  various  government-issued  and  legal

documents. The key documents include

A. Title & Ownership Documents

1.

Sale Deed – The most crucial document proving legal ownership. It must be registered

with the Sub-Registrar of Assurances under the Registration Act, 1908.

2.

Gift Deed – If the property is gifted, this document legally transfers ownership. Must be

registered.

3.

Partition Deed – Establishes division of ancestral property among legal heirs.

4.

Conveyance Deed – Used in cases of land transfer, particularly in government land

acquisitions.

5.

Will & Probate – Proof of inheritance, especially when a legal heir acquires land/property.

6.

Relinquishment Deed – Document where a co-owner surrenders their ownership rights.

B. Government Land Records & Revenue Documents

1.

Record of Rights (RoR) / Jamabandi / Khatian / Khatauni – Maintained by state revenue

departments; shows land ownership and tenancy details. 

2.

Land Mutation Records – Updates ownership in revenue records after sale, inheritance,

or gift.

3.

Khasra & Khatauni – Village-level records containing land details, area, and ownership

status.

4.

Encumbrance Certificate (EC) – Confirms that the land is free from legal or financial

liabilities. Essential for property transactions.

5.

Survey & Settlement Records – Government records that verify land ownership,

boundaries, and classification.

6.

Patta M - Land assignment order - KL

C. Tax & Utility Documents

1.

Property Tax Receipts – Proof of land possession and municipal record linkage. Issued by
local municipal bodies.

Page: 46

D. Court & Legal Documents

1.

Registered Lease Agreement – Establishes rights of tenants and leaseholders.

2.

Court Orders & Judgments – Ownership disputes settled through litigation.

3.

Adverse Possession Proofs – If someone occupies land for 12+ years (private land) or 30+

years (government land), they may claim ownership under the Limitation Act, 1963.

E. Government-Issued Approvals & Certificates

1.

Patta Certificate / Government Grant Orders – Proof of ownership for assigned land,

issued by state governments.

2.

No Objection Certificates (NOCs) – Clearance from government departments (e.g.,

urban development, municipal authorities).

3.

Allotment Letter (for Government/Housing Schemes) – Proof of allocated land or

property under government schemes.

4.

Agricultural Land Conversion Certificate – If agricultural land is converted to

residential/commercial use, this is mandatory.

F. State-Specific Variations

Since land is a state subject in India, the document names may vary from State to State. For

example:-by state for example

     ❖ Maharashtra: 7/12 Extract (Satbara Utara) for land ownership.

     ❖ Karnataka: RTC (Record of Rights, Tenancy & Crops).

     ❖ Telangana/Andhra Pradesh: Pahani Document.

     ❖ West Bengal: Porcha.

     ❖ Uttar Pradesh/Bihar: Bhulekh/Khasra-Khatauni.

     ❖ Kerala: Pattayam - Land assignment order

Updation of textual and spatial records prior to commencement of the process of disposal

of claims and objections

b) Action at Field Level 

A  Special  Team  may  be  appointed  constituting  Revenue,  Urban  officers  other  than  the

initial survey Team for disposing of Claims & objections, if any or published Map 2.

The land parcel/ plot level/building spatial data shall be carried to field through a mobile

app / hard copy.

The  Survey  team  shall  carry  with  them  the  plot  wise  information  of  ownership,  as  per

revenue/municipal records, in respect of all the  land parcels to be re-surveyed.

The land parcel /property details available with the survey team shall be tallied with the

details contained in the ownership documents, as mentioned in para 7.1 presented by the

land holder in possession of the plot/land parcel.

The  survey  team  and  the  other  presented  by  the  land  holder  in  possession  at  the  site),

due to transfer of the land parcel/plot/property, by way of succession, sale, gift, 

Page: 47

 
relinquishment, mortgage, partition and subdivision etc, not followed by updation,  the

land  holder  shall  be  advised  to  submit  an  application  for  updation  of  the  ownership

details.  In  case  of  disputes  over  the  ownership/boundaries  being  raised  before  the

survey team, also the parties shall be advised to submit applications in support of their

respective claims.

In  case  of  variations  in  the  details  in  the  two  sets  of  the  record  (one  available  with  the

survey team and the other presented by the land holder in possession at the site), due to

transfer  of  the 

land  parcel/plot/property,  by  way  of  succession,  sale,  gift,

relinquishment,  mortgage,  partition  and  subdivision  etc,  not  followed  by  updation,  the

land  holder  shall  be  advised  to  submit  an  application  for  updation  of  the  ownership

details.  In  case  of  disputes  over  the  ownership/boundaries  being  raised  before  the

survey team, also the parties shall be advised to submit applications in support of their

respective claims. Or The Special Team shall conduct enquiry and issue speaking order

regarding the claim/objection. If there arise any dispute between the parties, the special

team shall decide the disputes in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law,

so as to limit the claims and objections at the later stage after publication of map

Special  efforts  shall  be  made  by  the  Revenue/  Settlement/  Municipal  Authority

concerned  to  update  the  ownership  details,  decide  the  disputes  received  through  the

survey teams, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable law, so as to limit the

claims and objections at the later stage after publication of MAP-2.

c) Survey / Mutation Camps 

The  States  Revenue  Departments  and  ULBs  could  consider  holding  special  camps  to

facilitate alignment of the possession status with the status in the ownership records in

all the clear / undisputed cases, by way of mutation/ updation of records for ownership

change, partitions/ divisions and amalgamations of properties, property tax liability.

Adequate  publicity  of  the  camp  information  as  also  the  procedure,  the  documents

required to be presented and the witnesses to be produced by the land holders at the

camp shall have to be ensured.

During the intervening period before the survey teams commence their work in the field,

the State / UT Governments could consider inviting online/ physical applications/ claims

for  updation  of  records  and  dispose  them  of  in  a  time  bound  manner  so  that  the

information to be taken by the survey teams to the field is as accurate as possible.

For smooth passage of the survey process, the provisions which have worked well in the

states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Kerala,  Karnataka  and  Madhya  Pradesh  may  mutatis

mutandis, be adopted by other states through the appropriate process of amendment

in the revenue / survey rules.

The claims and objections should be disposed of by the competent Survey Authority in

accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  rules  in  a  time  bound  manner  and  the  status  as

per the decision should be updated in the attribute table in a separate column.

Page: 48

Help desks and help lines for the guidance of the stakeholders in the process of

updation shall be set up to operate under the supervision of the State PMU

d) Format of Property Card 

A model format of the property card to include required attributes of land and building,

including apartments in multi-ownership complexes, with the aim to suggest a provision

for  a  comprehensive  tool  for  transparency,  accuracy  and  legal  compliance,  is  given  at

Annexure-3.  The  State/UT  may  modify  the  format,  if  required,  and  notify  it  as  part  of

their respective Revenue/Survey Rules and Manuals.

▪ Integration of existing databases with UrPro

To  ensure  accuracy  of  the  Land  and  Property  Ownership  data  and  its  synchronization

with  property  tax  data,  an  automated  mutation  trigger  mechanism  is  necessary.  This

mechanism  will  automatically  update  NAKSHA  records  including  property  tax  data

whenever  there  is  a  change  in  the  land  ownership,  land-use  categorization,  or  other

property-related attributes.

The  integration  of  the  data  maintained  by  all  the  relevant  departments  like  Revenue,

Registration,  Forest,  Town  Planning  and  Agriculture  can  be  done  through  Web-based

mechanisms. It will facilitate automatic updation of the changes made in one system to

instantly reflect in the other, reducing/ obviating the need of manual intervention with

ensured  consistency  between  ownership  and  tax  data.  This  facility  will  trigger  auto-

mutations  in  real-time  providing  accurate,  up-to-date  information  on  urban  land

transactions, ownership changes, and tax implications.

In the cases where the data are still in physical form and real-time synchronization is not

possible,  the  interim  solutions,  such  as  batch  updates  or  scheduled  uploads  of  offline

records  on  WebGIS  to  ensure  that  the  system  remains  up-to-date,  should  be

considered.  While  automation  of  the  mutation  process  is  key  to  streamlining  land

administration,  these  temporary  measures  will  help  maintain  data  accuracy  during  the

transition from offline to fully online systems.

e) Key Components of the UrPro

The Model Format is annexed (Annexure-3) contains details to facilitate Administrative

Identification, Land Parcel/ Plot information including land ownership details, building/

9.2.2 Title Enquiry Guidelines for Government
Land (Karnataka)

Title  Enquiry  Guidelines  for  Government  Land  in  case  of  land  grants/  allotment  or  layout

development (Karnataka)

Page: 72

A. In case the property on "government land" was issued in the name of a private person(s)

in  the  Revenue  records,  and  the  private  person  (or  their  successors)  are  in  possession  of

the  said  land,  then  such  revenue  records  shall  be  accepted  and  accordingly  the  owner

therein or his legal successors through registered deed or inheritance/succession, shall be

accepted  as  the  owner.  The  revenue  records  shall  override  the  municipal  records  in  case

there is a conflict between the two.

B. In general, in absence of Revenue Records, for the properties on "government land" the

document  of  grant  of  the  said  government  land  or  revenue  survey  number  to  the  private

person  is  mandatory.  Thereupon  the  flow  of  ownership  of  the  granted  land,  or  a  piece

thereof, from the grantee to the present claimant of property should be there to accept the

present  claimant  and  record  him  as  owner  leading  to  issuance  of  Urban  Land  Record.

Provided that in case there is a proper document of grant of government land to a private

person but subsequent documents a.creating a clear chain of flow of ownership is missing,

then the municipal ownership records can be relied on to issue the Urban Land Record.

C.  For  the  properties  on  the  layouts  of  government  agencies  on  the  government  land,  the

allotment letter of the agency develops the layout, registered deed from such an agency to

a  person  is  the  primary  document  of  ownership.  In  case  such  a  document  is  given  by  a

citizen or otherwise available, the same shall be the basis of recording the property owner.

Provided  that  in  case  of  subsequent  transfer  of  property  or  inheritance  or  succession  of

such  property  by  the  original  owner,  the  latest  owner  shall  be  recorded.  The  municipal

ownership records in such layouts shall be given due value in accepting the present owner

of the property.

D.  In  absence  of  a  government  land  grant  or  recording  of  property  as  private  property  in

any revenue record, and the property is not part of the layout of a government agency, then

the Urban Land Record shall not be issued to private persons on government land. Provided

the Urban Land Records to Government Agencies and departments can be issued.

E.  In  case  the  government  land  grant  document  for  the  concerned  land  in  favour  of  a

private person is available or the grant is proved as per Government procedure, then apart

from  chain  of  documents  proving  flow  of  ownership  of  present  claimant  from  the  original

grantee  of  land;  the  ownership/title  as  per  municipal  records  shall  also  be  accepted.  The

Urban Land Record may be accordingly issued.

F. In accepting and recording the ownership of any property on a granted Government land

where  the  land  grant  document  is  available  or  layout  on  government  is  done  by  a

government  agency,  any  documents  or  records  that  are  received  /obtained  from  the

citizen  or  any  other  authority  should  be  duly  considered  as  per  their  legal  value.  In  this

regard, the following broad principles shall be adopted –

a.

The  revenue  records  are  primary  and  shall  override  municipal  records  in  case  of

contradiction.

b.

The allotment letter or registered deeds from government agencies that developed

layout  on  the  government  land  are  also  primary  documents  and  shall  override

municipal records in case of contradiction.

9.2.3 Good Practice on Simplified and
Standardized Forms

The  Andhra  Pradesh  SOP  for  urban  resurvey  specifies  forms  for  all  stages  of  the  survey

process.  This  enables  efficient  scaling  up  of  the  survey  across  the  state,  brings  in

standardization  in  operations,  and  transparency  and  convenience  for  both  officers  and

citizens.

Some of the key forms used in the state for the purpose of resolving disputes regarding the

boundary inaccuracies have been presented. Specific forms are utilized at different stages

of  the  survey,  during  ground  truthing  and  appeals.  These  forms  serve  as  official

documentation for addressing the objections, verifying and correcting the discrepancies. 

Similar  forms  may  be  adapted  by  states  for  their  own  purposes.  The  forms  regarding

various  stages  of  the  urban  survey  process  in  Andhra  Pradesh  can  be  retrieved  from  the

SOP document of the state.

13. Real time updated data by Integration and synchronization of data across all the
stakeholder departments: 

(i) It is helpful to seed mobile and Aadhar number in the data base and integrate the data
maintained by all the relevant departments like Revenue, Registration, Forest, Town
Planning and Agriculture through web-based mechanisms so as to facilitate real time
updation for ensuring consistency between ownership and tax data.

(ii) The States/UTs where the records are in physical form or real-time synchronization is
not possible, batch updates or scheduled uploads of offline records on property data Web-
GIS platform should be carried out to maintain the data up to date.
